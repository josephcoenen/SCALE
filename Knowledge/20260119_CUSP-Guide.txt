By providing a solar-powered steel fra.mework, we empower communities to transform dark public spaces into resi.lient, self-managed hubs for work, light, and connectivity. It is a tactical blueprint for decentralized urban growth and so.cial autonomy.List of Contents	01 I Background & Motivation 	02 I Why SCALE 	03 I The Team	04 I Operations & Governance1 I Framework 	1.1 	1.2 	1.3 	1.4 	1.5 List of Materials 2 I Urban Integration 	2.1 	2.2 3 I Typologies 	3.1 	3.2 4 I Data & Fakts 	4.1 	4.2 	4.33INTRODUCTION01 I Background and MotivationOur architectural intervention is rooted in deep-field research conducted in Brixton, Johannesburg. Through immersive site visits and qualitative interviews with local residents, we identified a critical „Infrastructure Gap.“ In an environment where the national grid is increasingly unreliable, the lack of light and electricity is not just a technical failure - it is a social one.We observed that the absence of power directly leads to a decrease in public safety and a loss of community agency. This discovery led us to focus on the Energy-Safe.ty Nexus: the belief that a well-lit, powered, and accessible space is the fundamental right of every urban citizen.02 I Why SCALE?The traditional approach to urban shelter is often static and high-maintenance. SCA.LE (Solar Construction kit for Adaptive Local Energy) breaks this mold by introducing a dy.namic infrastructure that grows with the community.1Scalability by Design The modular steel framework allows for a „Seed-to-Network“ progression. What starts as a single light pole in Year 1 can evolve into a full-scale community hub by Year 10.2Radical Adaptation Unlike fixed kiosks, SCALE is an empty vessel. Its „Open-Frame“ logic allows users to appropriate the space-switching from a transit stop to a security node or a workspace within minutes.3Resilient Autonomy By integrating off-grid solar technology into the roof structure, SCALE remains a „Beacon of Power“ even during the most se.vere load-shedding periods, ensuring that the Brixton corridor never goes dark.4Low-Barrier Implementation By utilizing a „Construction Kit“ approach, we minimize the need for heavy machinery and specialized labor, emp.owering local welders and artisans to become part of the production cyc.le.Investment in SCALE is not an investment in a product, but in the stability of a neighborhood. By securing the street level with energy and light, we increase local property value, foster micro-economies, and reduce the long-term costs of urban neglect.SCALE - Solar Construction  & Adaptive Local Energy 403 I The TeamWe are a multidisciplinary team of designers and urban researchers dedicated to reimagining the future of public infrastructure. Founded as a Non-Profit Organiza.tion (NPO), our work sits at the intersection of architecture, social engineering, and sustainable technology.Our journey began during an academic expedition to Johannesburg, where we wit.nessed firsthand the resilience of the Brixton community. This experience transfor.med our perspective: we stopped seeing the city as a collection of problems and started seeing it as a landscape of opportunities for tactical intervention. Joseph CoenenGina Maria LinkeLili DongCommunity Engagement & Center ManagementArchitectural Design & Systems EngineeringUrban Strategy & Research04 I Our Mission as an NPOAs an NPO, we operate on the principle of „Infrastructure as a Public Good.“ Our role is to act as the bridge between research and reality. We don‘t just design kits; we facilitate urban change.We ResearchWe analyze the socio-spatial needs of the neighborhood.We PrototypeWe develop low-cost, high-impact hardware like the SCALE framework.We EmpowerWe partner with local stakeholders to ensure that the technology is owned and maintained by the community itself.5INTRODUCTION04 I Operations & GovernanceNPO Scouts External partiesTarget DemographicsWomen (with children)Informal EconomyRecyclersCommutersChildren/StudentsRoofless PeopleCenter NPO (Intake)InvestorsCity of JohannesburgNPOProviders for Material Apply for temorary structure permit Collab with local economiesCenter NPO (Operates) Local Scarp YardsDirect Partnership & SupportManagesStrategic Framework for Managed Public Service PointsTo ensure that SCALE be.comes a lasting part of Brixton’s urban fabric, we have developed a triparti.te operational model. This framework manages the transition from a techni.cal kit to a living commu.nity hub (The Center).Public Services PointsTarget DemographicsSolar Construction Build & MaintainSolar Construction Solar Construction SCALE - Solar Construction  & Adaptive Local Energy 61Social Strategy I Outreach & Targeted GroupsIdentifying and integrating the community before construction begins.Active Recruitment The Intake ProcessDirect PartnershipWe utilize „NPO Scouts“ to proactively find partici.pants, moving beyond passive word-of-mouth.Target demographics (e.g., women-led households or waste pickers) visit the Center NPO to define specific needs - from safety to workspace.Establishing a „Direct Partnership & Support“ model between the NPO and participants to bypass tradi.tional bureaucratic bottlenecks.2Operational Framework I Governance & ResourcesProviding the legal and logistical backbone.Streamlining development via „Temporary Structu.re Permits“ with the City of Johannesburg for rapid deployment.Collaborating with material providers and local scrap yards to integrate the local economy into the supply chain.The NPO manages the financial framework and in.vestor communications to ensure long-term sustai.nability.Agile PermittingResource Circularity Investor Relations3Site Stewardship I Interaction & MaintenanceManaging the daily life of the site.The Center NPO manages day-to-day interactions and maintenance directly on-site.Users are active partners in the „Build & Maintain“ process, fostering a sense of responsibility and ow.nership.Safety is maintained through constant presence and „Social Surveillance“ rather than high-tech se.curity.The direct link between the NPO and users allows for real-time handling of disputes or maintenance requests.Direct Operations Co-ProductionSocial SurveillanceIssue Resolution1FRAMEWORKThe Structural Backbone of Urban ResilienceThe Framework is more than just a steel structure; it is the physical foundation of the SCALE system. Designed as a high-durability „Solar Skeleton,“ it provides the necessary infrastructure for light, energy, and shelter in an unpre.dictable urban environment.By utilizing a modular Construction Kit logic, the frame.work allows for rapid deployment and radical adaptati.on. It is a permanent, off-grid anchor in the neighborhood that remains open for community appropriation—trans.forming from a simple light-node into a complex hub of social and economic activity.9FRAMEWORK1.1 I The Archetypes One System, Two VolumesThe SCALE framework is defined by two fundamental archetypes. While sharing the same structural DNA and „Basic“ components, they provide different spatial capa.cities to respond to diverse urban requirements.Type A I The Compact Construction2,40x1,80 mAWith a footprint of 2.40.1.80 m, this type is op.timized for narrow transit zones.
